A program that stores a list of Employees along with information regarding their wages.

There is no GUI, as I intended this to be a simple excercize in utilizing abstract classes and inheritence. 
Employees are created as either an HourlyEmployee or a SalariedEmployee, both of which inherit from the
abstract class Employee. Employees are stored with either their hourly wage or yearly salary. Included is the option
to display with weekly pay of each Employee, as well as raise wages by a specified percentage.
